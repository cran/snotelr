# snotelr

SnotelR is a R toolbox to facilitate easy SNOTEL data exploration and downloads through a convenient R [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) based GUI. In addition it provides a routine to extract basic snow phenology metrics.

## Installation

### stable release

To install the current stable release use a CRAN repository:

``` r
install.packages("snotelr")
library("snotelr")
```

### development release

To install the development releases of the package run the following
commands:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("khufkens/snotelr")
library("snotelr")
```

Vignettes are not rendered by default, if you want to include additional
documentation please use:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("khufkens/snotelr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("snotelr")
```

## Use

Most people will prefer the GUI to explore data on the fly. To envoke the GUI use the following command:

```R
library(snotelr)
snotel_explorer()
```

This will start a shiny application with an R backend in your default browser. The first window will display all site locations, and allows for subsetting of the data based upon state or a bounding box. The bounding box can be selected by clicking top-left and bottom-right.

The *plot data* tab allows for interactive viewing of the soil water equivalent (SWE) data together with a covariate (temperature, precipitation). The SWE time series will also mark snow phenology statistics, mainly the day of:

- first snow melt
- a continuous snow free season (last snow melt)
- first snow accumulation (first snow deposited)
- continuous snow accumulation (permanent snow cover)
- maximum SWE (and its amount)

To access the full list of SNOTEL sites and associated meta-data use the **snotel.info()** function.

```R
# returns the site info as snotel_metadata.txt in the current working directory
snotel_info(path = ".") 

# export to data frame
meta-data <- snotel_info(path = NULL) 

# show some lines of the data frame
head(meta-data)
```

To query data for e.g. site 924 as shown in the image above use:

```R
snotel_download(site_id = 924)
```

For in depth analysis the statistics in the GUI can be retrieved using the **snotel_phenology()** function

```R
# with df a SNOTEL file or data frame in your R workspace
snotel_phenology(df)
```

# Notes
Use the proper acknowledgements when using the downloaded data.
